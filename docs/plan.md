the overall idea is that as the delivery arrives, the receiver will scan a particular product's barcode from a batch on our app and then our app will fetch the products details from the grocery store's database and then we will add more info to that like expiry date and then we will enter the quantity of products we received so it will print the number of qr code stickers containing info for each product like: {   product id: 1 // unique for each item,      productName: Coca cola 500 ml // matching the store's database, expiry date: // in yymmdd format,  batchNumber: 5 //same for a particular batch received, status: "In stock" // "Donated", "On discount", "expired"} and then a person or with the help of a machine the QR codes will be sticked onto the respective products and meanwhile, as the products are added by the receiver in the app, they are automatically added to the stock database as well.          
So, depending on the sales data in the database and the inventory data, our AI will suggest the manager with alerts that they should put the specific product on discount or donate them so I want a separate page for the actions required suggested by AI. That page will have all the suggestions given by AI in the form of blocks with the suggestion message on the top, in the middle the product info and quantity and then two action buttons in the bottom: "Discount" or "Donate" which will take them to separate pages . the first one is the discount page which will have a form and the donate page will have links to some local food banks to which they could donate by clicking on the donate button and a notification will be sent to that respective food bank. Further more the home page will be a dashboard page which will have in depth graphs giving insights into their savings and how much they donating and how much they are discounting and their overall profits , things like this. I am using Nextjs, typescript shadCN, tailwind CSS and OpenAI API to build this
